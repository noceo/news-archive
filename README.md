# NewsArchive

A web application built to make news explorable. Every single day news get pulled from an external API. These articles are stored in a MYSQL database and made accesible for the client via an Express.js API. The client is built with Nuxt.js and visually prepares the data to let the user explore the hotest news or news from the past.
